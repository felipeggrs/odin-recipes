# Odin-recipes
This is the first project in The Odin Project (TOP). The main objective of this one is to test if one has grasped the basic skills in HTML, such as:
- How to make a boilerplate
- How to make headers, paragraphs and lists
- How to create links and setup images on the page

Other than that, I find that one essential skill that they also teach you is how to navigate around the CLI in Linux and, after that, how to integrate your projects with Git and GitHub.

All in all, this project was fun to make. It wasn't complicated at all, since I didn't have to use CSS or JS yet, so everything in HTML, so far, has been pretty straightforward.

Onwards to CSS! :)
